The extension services are relevant for companies and projects that rely on wide network of smallholder farmers as their supply base. To ensure that these farmers access knowledge affordably and that the extension projects achieve their objectives, we have developed an e-learning platform through which training and coaching is offered on a continuum to a network of young agricultural advisors.</p>

											<div class="inner">
												<p>At Tradecare Mazao Safi, we understand how important it is for modern farmers to have the best and latest inputs and technology available to them. Thatâ€™s why, through partnership with input and technology service providers, we offer a wide range of inputs and technology packages tailored to the needs of the agricultural sector. This package allows for baseline registration of input providers interested in collaborating pre-competitively with the ESPs to improve production practices as a high-level objective and increase accessibility, availability, and affordability of different types of inputs. As the ESPs interact directly with farmers, the ESP Company negotiates for a percentage of revenue from sale of inputs to be paid to the ESP for the service provision. In return the ESP receives capacity support and backstopping services from input and technology providers.</p>

											<h4>3. Aggregation & market facilitation Package<span class="accrodion-icon"></span></h4>
										</div>
										<div class="accrodion-content">
											<div class="inner">
												<p>This service package is offered to the aggregators and buyers who may be the main client of an extension project. The package central to the setup of an extension project. At the heart of result-based extension and the RASTA model is the private sector / commercial buyers who can sustain demand for products grown in the extension project. The set-up of result-based extension however does not require ESPS to work with only one buyer. With farmers involved in multiple commercial crop and livestock enterprises, it is possible to work with multiple aggregators or buyers if the extension project works with them pre-competitively. An example is a situation where an extension project works with an avocado buyer in an area where farmers also grow macadamias and tomatoes. It is advisable for the ESP to reach out to multiple buyers to ensure that the farmers can sell their macadamias as well as tomatoes. This allows for lowering of costs and increased commercial viability and sustainability of the extension project.</p>
